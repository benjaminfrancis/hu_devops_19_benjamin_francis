*For passwordless authentication I have generated a ssh key and copied the ssh public key to the github  and created  a repo called hu_devops_19_benjamin_francis and cloned that repo to my local machine.
*Created a branch called git-assignment using command git checkout -b branch-name
Created a file called secrets which contain my username and password and added it into the .gitignore file for not reflecting it in the git repository while pushing to git repository

Created a security.md  file that contains how I handeled the secrets
